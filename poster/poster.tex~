% Poster is divided into three columns, and columns divided into 3,1 and 2 blocks (the map in the centre of the poster is not a block, just a graphic). The code in the white region is LaTeX language, and the code in the gray regions is R language.

% Block one: Scientific Question.
\begin{block}{Scientific Question}
  \textbf{Goal:} \quad To identify factors that are 
     associated with national averages of
     PISA math scores --  with the eventual goal of predicting national
     math aptitude among students in countries that are \emph{not}
     included in the PISA program.

% Block two: The Data  
\begin{block}{The Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Average math scores from 62 countries (3 removed)
    \item 5,000-30,000 students in each country 
  \end{itemize}
% Creating histograms of transformed and untransformed data.

% Block 3: Adjusting the data.
\begin{block}{Adjusting the Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since data are averages over countries -- we first transformed them to
    to satisfy the homoscedasticity assumption:
  \end{itemize}
% Equations for the weights:
  \[
    y = X\beta + \epsilon \quad \rightarrow \quad W^{\frac{1}{2}}y = W^{\frac{1}{2}}X\beta + W^{\frac{1}{2}}\epsilon \quad \mbox{,      \quad where}
  \]
% Matrix for the weights:
  \[
  W^{\frac{1}{2}} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
  \sqrt{n_1} & \cdots & 0 \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  0 & \cdots &  \sqrt{n_{62}}\\
  \end{array} \right], \quad n_j = \mbox{number of students in country~} j
